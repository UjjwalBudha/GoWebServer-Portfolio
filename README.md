## Web Server

This is a simple web server application written in Go (Golang) to host a portfolio website. The server handles static files, serves a basic form, and responds with a "hello" message.

### Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Go to the directory where the project is cloned.
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. **Run the Server**: Execute the Go program to start the web server.
   ```bash
   go run main.go
